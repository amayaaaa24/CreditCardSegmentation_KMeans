# CreditCardSegmentation_KMeans

This project focuses on utilizing K-means analysis to segment customers of a credit card company into distinct groups based on their unique characteristics. By achieving this segmentation, we aim to:

- Dataset Analysis: Thoroughly analyze the provided dataset.
- Data Preparation: Prepare the data for the clustering model.
- Cluster Determination: Identify the optimal number of clusters.
- Data Segmentation: Segment the data into meaningful customer groups.
- Outcome Interpretation: Interpret and elucidate the results of the customer segmentation.
